                <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
                <li>2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons white sugar </li>

            <ol class = "list">  
                <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. 
                    Beat until a stiff dough has formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough doubles in volume, 
                    about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a thin crust. 
                    Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings.</li>
                <li>Bake pizza in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
